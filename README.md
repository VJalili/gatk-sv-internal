# GATK-SV-Internal

This repository holds various workflows and scripts for internal use working with SV call sets. 

Many of these files were once included in the GATK-SV code base but have been moved here because they are not being actively maintained.

This is **NOT** the GATK-SV pipeline.

For GATK-SV, visit the [official repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk-sv).
